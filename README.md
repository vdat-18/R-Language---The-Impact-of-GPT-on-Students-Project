# 📊 Data Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing the **The-Impact-of-ChatGPT-on-Students** dataset using R. The main objective is to process, analyze, and visualize data, including GIS (Geographic Information System) data, to generate insights and reports.

## 📋 Data Collection
The data was collected through a survey of 205 students from universities across Ho Chi Minh City (TPHCM), Vietnam. This survey aimed to gather insights on various aspects relevant to the project.

## 📁 Files in the Project

### 1. 📝 Report.R
- **Description**: This is an R script, used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Purpose**: The script contains R code to perform statistical analyses, generate visualizations, and create reports based on the data provided in the `MainData.csv` files.
- **Contents**: Common functions in this file include data cleaning, transformation, statistical tests, and plotting.
  
### 2. 📄 MainData.csv
- **Description**: A CSV file intended for use with the R script.
- **Purpose**: This dataset contains pre-processed and cleaned data in R.

### 3. 📂 RawData.csv
- **Description**: This is the unprocessed, original data version. This data is taken from the survey data via Google Forms.
- **Purpose**: The base dataset for further processing and analysis. This file contains the raw data without any transformations, cleaning, or preprocessing.
- **Usage**: This raw data is often loaded first to explore its structure and then undergoes cleaning and preparation steps in the R script.

### 4. 🌍 GisData.csv
- **Description**: This file contains GIS (Geographic Information System) data, including the longitude and latitude of universities in Ho Chi Minh City.
- **Purpose**: Useful for spatial analysis and geographic visualizations, such as mapping data points or analyzing patterns based on geographic distribution.
